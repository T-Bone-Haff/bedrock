**Haffey Enterprises engineering skills** — by T-Bone-Haff (Tad Haffey, Haffey Enterprises LLC).

Self-contained Claude skills distilled from the HE-Bedrock governance corpus. They carry the *content* — the engineering standard, the doctype templates, the testing and review disciplines — with none of the private self-governance machinery. No skill depends on another skill being loaded; a skill's own depth lives in its bundled `reference/` and `templates/` files (some skills are a single SKILL.md). Portable actor contracts name optional host profiles without embedding a private runner, tracker, path, or authority corpus.

## What's in the kit

The kit spans the authoring-through-review lifecycle on the house stacks — service, infrastructure, agent, frontend, and pipeline work alike. Each capability is a self-contained skill that Claude auto-discovers and triggers by task; the live roster is the plugin's [`skills/`](plugins/bedrock/skills) folder, every skill carries its own description, and the plugin manifest carries the current summary. This README deliberately restates neither.

## Stack binding

Bindings are declared per skill, not kit-wide. The service-side skills assume **Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / async SQLAlchemy / GCP / GitHub**; the frontend skill binds **TypeScript / React / Vite** with plain CSS on design tokens; the pipeline skill binds **GitHub Actions + GCP** on the house branch model; reasoning-protocol skills like `debug` and `author-standard` are stack-agnostic. `agent-code` and `design-review-loop` expose provider/runner-neutral cores plus explicit optional profiles. A profile binds the portable contract without becoming its authority.

## Install — Claude Code

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add T-Bone-Haff/bedrock
/plugin install bedrock@bedrock
```

For local development of the kit itself, point the marketplace at a clone instead: `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/bedrock`. Do **not** copy skill folders out of the repo by hand — a copied skill is an unsynced snapshot with no update path and no staleness signal; it will silently rot the moment the next release lands.

## Install — Claude.ai / Cowork

Install through the plugin marketplace: Settings → Customize → Plugins → Add marketplace from repository (`T-Bone-Haff/bedrock`) → install **bedrock**. The skills load account-wide from the plugin. Do not upload skills as individual ZIPs — hand-uploaded copies are unsynced snapshots that compete with the plugin's skills for routing.

## Staying current

Distribution behavior differs by surface. Claude.ai/Cowork loads a pushed
marketplace version in the next new session. Claude Code requires marketplace
refresh/update, plugin update, and a new session. Neither path requires copying
the skill corpus into consumer repositories.

A release completes only after cold acceptance, an immutable tag and GitHub
release matching the manifest, and verification of every enumerated consumer
surface. The operational rollout ledger may live in the HE-Bedrock tracker, but
it conforms to the installed schema and cannot replace the package's
load-bearing lifecycle rules. See the [package lifecycle](plugins/bedrock/governance/README.md),
[compatibility matrix](plugins/bedrock/governance/COMPATIBILITY.md), and
[security/support policies](plugins/bedrock/governance/POLICIES.md).

Any snapshot a consumer keeps anyway — a vendored authority file or pinned copy
— must verify currency at time-of-use against the current release, not against
the baseline it was copied from.

On hosts that expose only skill-local files, each skill's generated
`PACKAGE_IDENTITY.json` provides that verification surface. It repeats the
manifest identity and digest without becoming a second version authority.

## Quickstart and profile rebinding

The [routing quickstart](plugins/bedrock/governance/QUICKSTART.md) gives explicit,
implicit, overlap, and non-trigger examples. The
[worked rebind specimen](plugins/bedrock/governance/REBINDING.md) demonstrates
how a non-house stack preserves portable invariants without silently becoming a
supported profile.

## Maintenance

Edit the relevant skill's authored files directly — the SKILL.md and any bundled
`reference/` or `templates/` files; single source of truth per skill. Do not
hand-edit `PACKAGE_IDENTITY.json`: after a manifest or Claude-adapter identity
change, regenerate all 13 copies with
`python3 scripts/sync_package_identity.py --write`. Releases follow the push
discipline in the `author-standard` skill.

### Validation

Install the pinned validation dependency, then run the deterministic and host checks:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r validation/requirements.txt
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/sync_package_identity.py --check
python3 scripts/validate_plugin.py
python3 scripts/validate_package_governance.py
bash scripts/smoke_clean_install.sh
```

`validate_plugin.py` deterministically enforces the 13-skill inventory, strict YAML frontmatter, the 1,024-character description limit, explicit positive and negative routing boundaries, unique names, plugin/marketplace coherence, package lifecycle and policy contracts, relative-link and private-path safety, declared external-root dependencies and snapshot currency markers, complete code-sample accounting, evidence-manifest integrity, and routing-fixture coverage. It separately runs `claude plugin validate --strict` against the plugin manifest; that host check does not claim recursive skill-frontmatter coverage.

`validate_package_governance.py` separately exposes the package gate for seeded
tests and release automation. Its default mode validates a candidate. Its
`--release` mode additionally requires paths to operator-supplied, schema-valid
release evidence and a completed consumer-surface rollout ledger, and proves
both against the immutable tag. It is a final release-closure check, not a
pre-HEB-119 candidate gate.

`sync_package_identity.py --check` proves the 13 skill-local identity carriers
are byte-identical, canonical generations of the manifest and registry
authorities. The package-governance validator enforces the same contract.

Shared routing prompts live in `tests/fixtures/routing.yaml` and are surface-neutral. They cover direct, implicit, adversarial, negative, and overlap decisions. The Claude Code adapter presents the exact validated name/description catalog to each isolated model session, so the regression measures the metadata routing contract rather than unaided name association, and retains machine-readable results:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_routing_evals.py \
  --profile release \
  --output docs/evidence/heb-109/routing-results.json
```

The live adapter requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and incurs model usage. Its
`claude --bare --print` execution path intentionally does not read Claude
subscription/OAuth or keychain authentication, so `claude auth status` is not
an adapter preflight. The harness first checks for the API-key credential source;
the first real case invocation then validates that credential and the exact
adapter execution path without adding a separate model call. Any authentication,
API-access, transport, or model failure aborts the remaining matrix immediately
and writes sanitized failure evidence instead of counting the failure as a
routing miss. Pull requests use the preregistered `pr` profile: every case runs
once and every draw must pass. Authenticated retained evidence uses the `release`
profile: three independent draws per case, at least a 95% aggregate pass rate, at
least two of three passing draws for every case, and zero excluded-route
selections. The machine-readable report records fixture, catalog, and policy
SHA-256 digests; results with different identities are not pooled. Each model
call is capped at $0.04 and 120 seconds. Deterministic validation and the isolated
install/reload smoke test do not require model inference. Branch protection must
require `Plugin validation / live-routing`.

Using `--case` creates an explicitly targeted report. It can prove that selected cases passed, but the report is marked ineligible as retained full-suite release evidence.

`validation/executable-samples.yaml` accounts for every language-tagged skill example. `fixture-backed` entries name executable evidence; `illustrative` and `deferred` entries name the correction ticket that owns stronger proof. `docs/evidence/heb-109/manifest.yaml` ties validation claims to reproducible commands, retained evidence, and explicit deferrals.
