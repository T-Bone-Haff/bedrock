## 1. Context

Bedrock currently ships thirteen skills through a Claude plugin manifest. The skill bodies mix portable engineering invariants, Haffey-specific operating choices, host assumptions, and references to capabilities that are not present in the distributable package. Some skills assume sibling skills or private execution machinery, while package prose claims self-containment. Routing is validated for the current catalog, but the package does not yet define a cross-host capability, authority, dependency, output, or lifecycle contract.

Bedrock must settle those boundaries before substantive skill rewrites. Otherwise each correction can independently choose what is portable, what is house policy, what a host must provide, which artifact wins on conflict, and whether a skill describes one reasoning act or an entire durable workflow. The existing design-review machinery exposes that last ambiguity: portable review semantics and product-specific lifecycle execution have been conflated. Product pressure-testing across discover/decide, build/operate, publish/engage, and measure/learn workflows showed that the common need is a promotion boundary, not a universal Bedrock workflow model.

## 2. Decision

Bedrock is a versioned, Agent Skills-compatible engineering commons. It owns selected reusable actor contracts, schemas, primitives, standards, templates, and evidence conventions; products own orchestration and may reconsume Bedrock components through explicit, capability-gated seams and thin surface adapters.

The governing principle is **product-owned orchestration with evidence-driven extraction and promotion of reusable components into Bedrock**. Promotion criteria and their proving process belong to a separate governance standard; this ADR establishes the ownership boundary but does not silently create that standard.

### 2.1 Product responsibility

The portable core owns:

- skill identity, task boundary, and routing precedence;
- normative engineering invariants and explicit profile seams;
- input, output, evidence, escalation, refusal, and failure contracts;
- shared vocabulary and schemas where mechanical identity is required;
- bundled relative resources, fixtures, and contract-critical rationale; and
- lifecycle status and compatibility requirements for each skill.

The portable core does not own host authentication, user-interface behavior, repository permissions, product workflow meaning or policy, product actor rosters or authority, product state transitions or operational posture, product-specific composition, durable workflow state, scheduling, retries, command registration, hook installation, or marketplace transport. Those concerns belong to the product or to other declared external capabilities.

Bedrock does not claim complete ownership of every engineering or operational domain. A coverage map names owned capabilities, explicit handoffs, and unowned or deferred domains. An absent owner is reported as a gap rather than covered by implication.

### 2.2 Core and adapter boundary

Canonical skill content uses portable frontmatter, relative resource paths, and vendor-neutral contracts. Codex/OpenAI, Claude, and Cursor integrations are adapters over that core. An adapter may add host-native discovery, commands, hooks, agents, permissions, or user-interface affordances, but it may not silently change a skill's normative meaning, routing boundary, required evidence, or failure semantics.

Host-specific enhancement is conditional on a declared capability. When an optional capability is absent, the adapter follows the declared degraded behavior. When a capability is required for the requested outcome, the adapter fails before work begins with the missing capability, affected operation, and available alternatives. It does not emulate success or claim evidence it could not produce.

Model Context Protocol is the preferred portable boundary for executable integrations. A non-MCP integration must expose an equivalent versioned capability and failure contract.

### 2.3 Authority and dependency

Every normative rule has one owner. Other surfaces point to that owner, generate a checked carrier, or carry a deliberately bounded contextual restatement. Hand-maintained duplicate authority is non-conforming.

Every reusable clause is classified by authority:

- **normative contract** — a requirement owned by one declared authority and usable for conformance;
- **profile** — a named, versioned choice that binds only consumers selecting that profile;
- **heuristic** — defeasible guidance labeled with its decision boundary and never sufficient by itself to declare non-conformance;
- **example** — an illustration that cannot widen or override the governing contract; or
- **generated carrier** — runtime-ready context derived from a declared source and checked for drift.

Optional guidance is a heuristic or profile, never an unlabeled weaker form of normative text. When classifications conflict, the normative owner wins; when ownership is unresolved, execution stops for disposition.

A skill's core task must not depend on another skill being loaded unless the dependency is explicit, versioned, machine-readable, and checked before execution. Bundled references and templates use relative paths and ship with the owning skill. External repositories, environment variables, command-line tools, services, models, and host capabilities are declared with version requirements, optionality, detection, and failure behavior.

Conflicts resolve through declared ownership and precedence. If two applicable authorities have no declared ordering or materially disagree, execution stops for disposition; an adapter may not choose silently.

### 2.4 Skill identity and routing

The thirteen current skill names remain stable through the contract migration. Each retains one primary job. Internal progressive-disclosure references may split without creating a new routable skill. A new, merged, renamed, or retired skill requires evidence that the routing or task boundary improves enough to justify migration cost.

Routing is determined first by requested operation, then by subject domain:

1. authoring, reviewing, diagnosing, testing, and executing are distinct operations;
2. the operation-owning skill is primary;
3. a domain skill may supply an explicitly allowed secondary overlay; and
4. unresolved overlap stops with the competing routes and the missing discriminator.

The catalog-wide precedence and per-skill dispositions are defined in the repository's skill architecture record.

Routing metadata and progressively disclosed content are governed by evidence budgets. Each routable description and the package aggregate have pre-registered size and confusion thresholds; skill bodies and templates load only the material needed for the selected operation. The architecture fixes that form now. Numeric thresholds remain held until routing, context-cost, cold-task, and completion evidence calibrate them.

### 2.5 Interaction and evidence contracts

Every skill declares:

- accepted task class and required inputs;
- produced artifact or result shape;
- evidence required for claims of completion or convergence;
- authority reserved to the operator or an external system;
- refusal and escalation conditions;
- required and optional capabilities; and
- behavior when a required input, authority, or capability is unavailable.

Prompt text is advisory unless an executable boundary enforces it. A skill must label advisory controls honestly and must not describe a prompt-only stop, approval, scope, or safety instruction as mechanically enforced.

### 2.6 Safety floor

No profile or adapter may weaken the package safety floor. The floor includes controlled sensitive-content capture, separation of untrusted code from trusted credentials, honest secret/state behavior, token audience and delegation controls, cookie/cross-site request forgery (CSRF) coupling, pinned executable dependencies, and evidence-backed artifact buildability. An affected operation is blocked when the safety floor cannot be satisfied.

### 2.7 Versioning and compatibility

The portable core contract, each adapter contract, and the distributable package have distinct version identities. A generated compatibility manifest maps their compatible ranges, required capabilities, optional enhancements, degraded behavior, and verified host versions.

A portable-core major change includes removing or renaming a skill, changing an established routing owner, breaking a declared input/output/evidence contract, changing authority or precedence, or increasing required capabilities without a compatible degraded path. Adapter-only host changes follow the adapter's version lifecycle.

The distributable package takes a major version when it includes a portable-core major, removes or renames a public skill, breaks installation or explicit invocation on a supported host, removes a supported host range, or makes a previously optional adapter capability mandatory without a compatible degraded path. Compatible core additions and adapter enhancements do not force a package major. The package version describes the aggregate release and does not substitute for either contract version.

Prompt-generation format has its own version and provenance. Generated carriers record generator version, source contract version, and source digest. Regeneration alone does not redefine the portable contract; a generated-format incompatibility is versioned at the affected generator or adapter boundary.

### 2.8 Actor contract and product-orchestration boundary

Bedrock skills define bounded task and actor contracts. An actor contract states the reasoning responsibility, authority, inputs, outputs, evidence, refusal, and escalation behavior for one operation. A routable skill may supply one actor contract or coordinate a bounded manual operation, but its prose is not a durable workflow engine.

Each product owns its workflow meaning, policy, actor or agent roster, authority assignments, state transitions, operational posture, and product-specific composition. A product controller may invoke Bedrock contracts through bounded, versioned command/result seams, but Bedrock does not prescribe a universal orchestration kernel, workflow recipe model, control plane, or domain-specific language. Reusable execution mechanics remain product-owned unless and until they are promoted under a separately ratified governance standard.

Capability and decision authority are separate. A model, prompt, skill, tool, or runtime capability does not acquire authority merely because it can perform an action. Invocation grants, tool permissions, budget limits, and approval rights are established and enforced outside prompts and models by the owning product or operator.

Under product policy, an authorized agent may delegate to bounded sub-agents, including parallel specialists. The product declares and enforces the permitted fanout, depth, aggregate budget, tools, data access, and decision authority; delegation cannot amplify the delegator's authority. Bedrock may supply reusable contracts or evidence conventions for such delegation only after promotion.

Existing product implementations and records are preserved as evidence and input for evaluating useful candidates; they are not Bedrock runtime designs to promote wholesale, and the preserved material creates no compatibility obligation.

Three assurance profiles preserve proportionality:

1. direct review performs one authority-cited adversarial read and does not claim mechanical convergence;
2. multi-perspective review runs isolated review actors and an explicit aggregation policy but does not claim durable or mechanical convergence; and
3. runner-backed convergence uses a declared, versioned runner and is the only profile that may emit a mechanically established convergence result when every applicable gate executes successfully.

No product runtime is a hidden dependency of Bedrock's portable core. A consumer without a runner capability may use a supported lower-assurance profile or fail before execution; it may not emulate runner-backed success.

### 2.9 Rebinding contract

A rebind is required only when a changed stack, host, authority corpus, doctype family, or execution capability changes part of the governing contract rather than selecting another already-declared profile. Every rebind produces:

1. the invariants preserved unchanged;
2. the axes and assumptions that changed;
3. the replacement authority and responsibility mapping;
4. migration and compatibility treatment;
5. exceptions, degraded modes, and refusal boundaries; and
6. proving evidence for the rebound contract.

A different configuration within an existing profile is not a rebind. A document that merely says "rebind" without these outputs is incomplete.

## 3. Rationale

The portable-core boundary lets one engineering contract survive host changes while keeping host-native affordances honest. It prevents the weakest host from limiting every surface and prevents the richest host from silently becoming the product definition. Capability gates turn missing integrations into inspectable states instead of hidden assumptions.

Separating Bedrock contracts from product orchestration and adapter/package authority makes correction tractable. A product can change workflow meaning, scheduling, model allocation, or runtime topology without silently changing a reusable actor contract; a host manifest can evolve without rewriting skill semantics; and a conflict can be traced to one owner. Stable skill names preserve the routing behavior already demonstrated while products remain free to compose them differently.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

### 4.1 One Claude-specific plugin as the canonical product

This would match the only currently shipped manifest and minimize near-term packaging work. It was rejected because host mechanics, house policy, and engineering invariants would remain inseparable; Codex and Cursor support would require either false compatibility claims or later architectural extraction.

### 4.2 Independent first-class forks for each host

Each host could optimize its own skill bodies, manifests, commands, and permission model. This was rejected because normative fixes and safety rules would have multiple owners, cross-host routing would drift, and no mechanical answer would exist when forks disagreed.

### 4.3 A universal bundle that assumes every integration exists

One bundle could describe all hooks, agents, commands, runners, and user-interface features and let hosts ignore unsupported instructions. This was rejected because ignored instructions create false completion and enforcement claims, while optional behavior becomes impossible to test or version coherently.

### 4.4 Portable core with implicit, best-effort integrations

The core could remain vendor-neutral while adapters probe opportunistically for tools and degrade informally. This was rejected because consumers could not distinguish a supported degraded mode from accidental under-execution, and evidence produced by different hosts would not be comparable.

### 4.5 Put the complete agent loop inside `design-review-loop`

The skill could own reviewer and author prompts, durable state, arbitration, convergence, cost policy, replay, and unattended operation as one package. This was rejected because a single skill would become both normative actor authority and runtime implementation, while the reusable orchestration lessons could not serve later authoring, coding, validation, and landing loops without duplication.

### 4.6 Let autonomous agents coordinate through free-form conversation

Agents could hand prose directly to one another until they collectively judge the work complete. This was rejected because conversation would become unversioned workflow state, completion would return to model judgment, failures would not resume deterministically, and the operator would have no durable decision or evidence seam.

### 4.7 Prescribe one reusable orchestration kernel from Bedrock

Bedrock could standardize a common recipe, kernel, and control-plane architecture before products implement their workflows. This was rejected because the four pressure-tested loop families carry different meanings, authorities, states, and operating postures. Premature standardization would turn an engineering commons into a control plane and encode one product's assumptions as shared contract. Products may still extract bounded reusable mechanics after evidence.

## 5. Consequences

### 5.1 Positive

- One authority governs skill semantics across supported hosts.
- Host-native features remain available without becoming undeclared requirements.
- Missing capabilities and conflicts have deterministic failure behavior.
- Skill corrections can separate portable invariants from Haffey profiles.
- Products can evolve orchestration independently while reusing stable Bedrock contracts.
- Products can use their implementations to produce promotion evidence without making current product architecture a Bedrock obligation.
- Compatibility, evidence, and release decisions become mechanically inspectable.

### 5.2 Constraints imposed

- Adapters cannot carry independent normative copies of the core.
- A private runner or tracker cannot load-bear on an installed skill's contract unless it is a declared, versioned, capability-gated dependency with exact unavailable behavior.
- Bedrock contracts, product orchestration, and adapter contracts cannot silently absorb one another's authority.
- Product policy owns model allocation, draw count, retry, delegation, and budgets unless a promoted Bedrock contract explicitly governs a reusable seam.
- The operator remains the authority for unresolved decisions and release gates even when workflow execution is unattended.
- New top-level skills require routing and context evidence, not taxonomy preference.
- Claims of enforcement, convergence, safety, or completion require evidence from the declared capability path.
- A consumer release cannot precede cross-surface conformance and an explicit release decision.

### 5.3 Risks

- The adapter boundary may become ceremonial if no schema or parity check enforces it. The signal is an adapter-only normative clause or unexplained cross-host output difference.
- Stable skill names may preserve a poor boundary. Routing confusion and context-cost measurements are the revisit signal.
- Product teams may duplicate mechanics before a promotion case reaches the separately governed promotion gate. Accumulated product evidence is the revisit signal; the separate governance standard decides whether promotion proceeds.
- Product bindings and Bedrock actor versions may drift. A product whose pinned contracts cannot be resolved or whose semantics changed incompatibly must stop or migrate explicitly.
- Capability declarations may become stale. A host-version mismatch or undeclared degraded path blocks release evidence.
- Layering can increase navigation cost. Cold-task completion time and unresolved-reference failures are the revisit signal.

### 5.4 Risk domains

- **Security:** no new execution capability, permission, identity, or authorization grant is created by this ownership correction. The existing safety floor remains applicable, so no additional security decision is required here.
- **Privacy:** this decision does not change data collection, processing, retention, disclosure, or residency. No additional privacy decision is applicable.
- **Compliance:** this decision does not change a regulated scope, control mapping, waiver, or accountable sign-off. No additional compliance decision is applicable.
- **Cost:** this decision establishes no runtime, service, resource allocation, or spending policy. Reuse economics belong to the separate promotion standard, so no additional cost decision is applicable here.
- **Operations:** product bindings can drift from Bedrock contract versions in the same way consumers can drift from any shared library. Explicit version identities, compatibility declarations, migration treatment, release evidence, and cold acceptance are the applicable controls; unresolved or unsupported combinations fail closed.

## 6. Compliance

Compliance is currently partly aspirational. The repository validates current skill structure, routing fixtures, clean installation, and the bounded safety contract for runtime coherence, secret/state honesty, immutable executable references, credential-free pull-request image builds, and convergence-classification consistency. It does not yet validate the full core/adapter contract.

Conformance will be enforced by:

- a machine-readable skill, authority, dependency, capability, and compatibility registry;
- versioned reusable actor and bounded command/result schemas; product-owned transition validation remains outside Bedrock unless later promoted;
- generated-or-checked adapter carriers;
- shared positive, negative, overlap, degraded-mode, and unavailable-capability fixtures;
- duplicate-authority, path, package, and vocabulary drift checks; and
- cold acceptance on every supported surface before release.

Until those mechanisms land, changes are checked against this record and the skill architecture record during design review. A claim that depends on an unimplemented mechanism remains conditional.

The ADR and its repository architecture carriers are documentation authority and do not ship in the plugin. The distributable package remains on its existing portable-core and package identities until the separately tracked HEB-128 implementation changes shipped bytes, derives the required package major from the then-live manifest, and passes its release gates. Until that implementation lands, package compatibility claims describe the shipped 1.0 core rather than conformance to this accepted 2.0 architecture.
